# wg-gateway

A "gateway" (UI/API) for Wireguard written in Python.

`wg-gateway` allows one to work with Wireguard via an API and Web GUI. This project is a work-in-progress and provides NO GUARANTEES, use at your own risk. This is a fun personal project of mine to learn more about wiregaurd, UI development and python.
